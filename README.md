### Implement a priority queue using the PriorityQueue<TElement, TPriority> class.

#### Use three methods:

- Enqueue(): Adds a task with a given priority.
- Peek(): Returns the highest-priority task without removing it.
- RemoveMin(): Removes and returns the task with the highest priority.

#### Testing:

- Add several tasks with priorities
- Test Peek() to confirm it returns "Finish project".
- Test RemoveMin() to verify tasks are removed in priority order.
